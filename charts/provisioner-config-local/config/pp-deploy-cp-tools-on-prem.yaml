pipelineName: "Deploy Control Plane On-Prem Stack"
description: |
  This pipeline will deploy supporting tools for CP on-prem use case.
  Currently it is tested for kind environment. We have to use github token to access the dev helm charts.
  After the deployment, you will get an email in MailDev to reset the password.
  You need to use port-forward to access MailDev. 
  ```bash
  kubectl port-forward svc/development-mailserver -n tibco-ext 1080:1080
  ```
  Then you can access MailDev at `http://localhost:1080`
